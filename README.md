# Automatic-torrent-sideloader
I created a small script that automatically sideloads a game to your quest from a magnet link!
The steps to use my script:

EDIT: This project is still alive. I just don't know what to add honestly

Type in the commands:


chmod +x [setup.sh](https://setup.sh)

chmod +x [torrenter.sh](https://torrenter.sh)

and run [setup.sh](https://setup.sh)

if u have any problems, try running the command with sudo

Now you can run [torrenter.sh](https://torrenter.sh) with the command:

sudo ./torrenter.sh

You can get magnet links from sites like rutracker

The script will ask you a couple of questions like: where is the downloaded game located(it will give you a folder list, u just have to input the folder name) and what is the folder's name with the obb files.

Feel free to ask if u have any questions
